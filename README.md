Ping Pong Score Keeper is a JavaScript project that enables you to keep track of scores in a ping pong game. This project provides a user-friendly interface for scoring, allowing you to increment the scores of two players using designated buttons. The UI also includes a reset button for starting a new game. The winning score is customizable and can be set using a dropdown menu.

When a player reaches the winning score, the game enters a "game over" state, disabling the score buttons and highlighting the winning player's score in green while the opponent's score is marked in red.

This project demonstrates the use of event listeners to update the scores, dynamically modify the UI based on game state, and reset the game when needed. It utilizes Bulma CSS framework for a responsive and visually appealing layout.

Ping Pong Score Keeper offers a convenient solution for keeping score during ping pong matches, whether it's a friendly game or a competitive tournament.
