# Score_Keeper
Ping Pong Score Keeper is a JavaScript project that allows you to keep score in a ping pong game. It provides buttons to increment the scores of two players and a reset button to start a new game. The winning score can be customised, and the UI updates dynamically to indicate the winner.
